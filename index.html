<h4>Friday, March 25, 2022</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Temptation is strong this morning. I’m rounding out week four of a months long abstinence from caffeine. The tricks my mind is playing are probably no different than an addict of any other substance. Why wait another week, it’s basically been a month? This is a silly game? What’s the difference between today and next Friday? I concede this is somewhat arbitrary but in the end I&rsquo;ll be somewhat proud of myself. Discipline is a scarce resource among us humans and I’m doing my best to impose just a little.</p>

<p>I’m so excited to map out a workbench this weekend. I’ve acquired all the necessary tools with the exception of a few I may need. A two inch butt chisel and maybe a panel saw depending on what dimensional lumber go with. My inspiration is peaking with this Bibbings & Hensby chair makers workbench. For the small space I currently inhabit it appears to be a perfect size with a top 25” by 30” and 31.5” tall. My current interests are small pieces at the moment: some stools, frames, end tables and if I dare, a Windsor. The research I&rsquo;ve done so far turned up a few other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://shawnmurphywindsorchairs.com/tools-supplies-work-benches.aspx>Shawn Murphy</a> sells a 4” thick top that’s 32” by 30” and 31.5” tall.</li>
<li><a href=https://www.curtisbuchananchairmaker.com/store/p23/Workbench_Plans_%28digital_download%29.html>Curtis Buchanan</a> sells some nice plans for a 3” thick top that’s 28” by 22.25” and 33” tall.</li>
<li><a href=http://greg-aroundtheshop.blogspot.com/2014/05/short-and-sweet-chairmakers-bench.html>Greg Pennington</a> built a walnut bench that appears to be 4” thick and 26.5” square.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still need to pour over the details to understand all the tradeoffs. The leg vise looks like the best option but I don’t want to rule out a moxon vise. A tail vise feels like overkill given the dimensions. The dueling holdfasts on the Bibbings example seems practical. The joinery on all the examples I’ve seen so far look much simpler compared to a traditional Roubo. I’ll report back when I’ve settled on some plans.</p>

<h3><a href=https://hungryfoolish.work/2022/getting-started/>Getting Started</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, February 23, 2022</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p>Plywood is wonderful. You can trust with almost certainty it&rsquo;s flat and square which jumpstarts your adventures (baltic birch is your friend). There are gobs of YouTubers making cool things with plywood. I could not stop watching <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1V-DYqsaj764uBis9-UDug>Chris Salomone</a> build all kinds of furniture, have no idea how I found him but he does a great job inspiring by way of talking through the process. Cristiana at <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETeXD_3awsQv-9rSdCYXQQ>Get Hands Dirty</a> has some great builds as well that are almost meditative to sit through. YouTube is filled with this stuff. It&rsquo;s also filled with tool reviews.</p>
<p>The urge to start buying tools happens quickly. After watching many tool reviews it became clear few could be trusted. Everyone is either sponsored by Woodpecker, Rockler or Kreg — all great brands but often overpriced and unecessary. I started out with some essentials to make picture frames and prototype some furniture.</p>
<p>It became pretty clear the first thing I needed was a table saw. Now, I could have bought a very affordable yellow branded saw but did the math and realized a trip to the emergency room (along with pain and suffering) wasn&rsquo;t worth skimping. So I bought the <a href=https://www.sawstop.com/table-saws/by-model/jobsite-saw>SawStop jobsite saw</a>, not cheap but it will refuse to saw off your fingers and cut wood like butter. I also like how easily it folds up as I have very little space to persue this passion.</p>
<p>The next tools I picked up were a good cordless drill and driver. I went with <a href=https://www.metabo.com/us/enus/>Metabo</a> because I saw a lot of construction workers using their stuff. It&rsquo;s good to be consistent because you&rsquo;ll want the freedom to swap batteries across power tools. At the time Metabo was the only brand with a multi-volt battery option which seemed benefitial down the road.</p>
<p>The next few things I bought were not necessary and I regret spending so much money on jigs that make it easy to cut miters or small pieces of material. When you watch people use these damn things it&rsquo;s hard to resist, I have learned my lesson. The last thing I bought was a combination square. Spent too much money on a trendy <a href=https://www.woodpeck.com/mini-in-dexable-squares.html>red aluminum thingy</a> when I should have just bought a Starrett.</p>
<p>With those tools I was able to build some nice picture frames out of elm. After getting comfortable with the table saw I went on to build very basic furniture out of cheap plywood. It&rsquo;s not furniture I&rsquo;m proud of but it&rsquo;s functional and helping me take baby steps towards the more serious world of hand tools and joinery.</p>

<h3><a href=https://hungryfoolish.work/2022/hello/>Hello</a></h3>
<h4>Wednesday, February 16, 2022</h4>
<div class=summary>
<p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> — My name is <a href=https://nathan.run>Nathan</a> and nothing brings me more joy than making something useful. Writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others was my story for the past two decades. This continues to be my day job but I&rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to occupy my free time.</p>
<p>When I was younger I couldn&rsquo;t wait to race home and work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard. Nowadays it&rsquo;s hard to wrestle with big corporate frameworks, programming languages, software that I&rsquo;m always upgrading and paying for and — god help us all — dependencies and build systems. I&rsquo;ve also helped bring a small child into the world and something is really tugging at me to create more useful physical objects the two of us can form memories around.</p>

In 2018 I attended the 50 year anniversary of the Whole Earth Catalog at Fort Mason in San Francisco. I&rsquo;ve always been inspired by this quote.

<p>So, in a blaze of cliche glory I&rsquo;m going to jump headlong into the world of woodworking, and maybe some other interests like sewing, felting, printmaking&mldr; you get the idea, physical stuff. Writing helps keep me honest so I&rsquo;ll do my best to document this adventure.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, depression is no stranger and I&rsquo;m sure many reading this know too well the crushing force it can have on the day-to-day. If I&rsquo;m not using my hands or my mind, if I&rsquo;m not feeling useful to others then my defenses weaken. The hunger to do never completely fades but starting something new is always scary, all attempts feel imperfect and low quality. Embrasing a foolish mindset, laughing at mistakes, getting in over my head is how I&rsquo;ve always fallen into new joys.</p>

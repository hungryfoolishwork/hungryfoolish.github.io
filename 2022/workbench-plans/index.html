<p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> â€”Â Downing my second espresso this morning in our small town coffeehouse as the weekend tourists pass through on their way to the mountains. This weekend I&rsquo;ll be building the legs and stretchers for my chairmakers workbench.</p>
<p>Plans are in a good place, spent many evenings watching YouTube and reading Christopher Schwarz&rsquo;s <a href=https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-workbench>Anarchist&rsquo;s Workbench</a>. Everything has been helpful to understand the craft and tactics involved in construction.</p>

<p>Getting into woodworking for me, specifically hand-tool woodworking, is meant to be a reprieve from the computer. Plans could be made entirely on paper but my mind is so used to thinking at the speed of software like Sketch or Figma it&rsquo;s hard to discard it completely. SketchUp, the tool most amateurs use to model in three dimensions was an option but I have a long hatred of modeling software. It&rsquo;s always felt fussy and too easy to get lost within. I don&rsquo;t really feel the need to spin things around in three dimensions on a screen, I can do that pretty well in my own mind. Having a way to do isometric sketches would be as close to 3d as I&rsquo;m willing to go.</p>

<p>A little about the bench, it&rsquo;s inspired by the Curtis Buchanan bench Bibbings & Hensby <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CazMzEHFDYC/>built recently</a>. A chairmakers workbench has a smaller top and is a little deeper. Using cheap and readily available Douglas Fur. No electric planer or jointer means I&rsquo;ll be relying entirely on hand planes to wrestle the boards to be flat and square. The top is laminated which took a few evenings to get flat (felt more like therapy than work). There leg vice will use <a href=https://www.benchcrafted.com/classic>Benchcrafted hardware</a> and there will be a series of bench dogs in front of the vice. I&rsquo;d like to use a couple holdfasts but unsure about placement. Most holdfasts I&rsquo;ve found are 1" in diameter rather than 3/4". Is it typical to have different sized holes for bench dogs and holdfasts? Hopefully in a couple days I&rsquo;ll have a freestanding bench ready to accept a vice ðŸ¤ž</p>

<p>The woodworking community should share plans more freely like the Open Source community I&rsquo;m so used to. Mine will be <a href=https://github.com/hungryfoolishwork/workbenches>here</a> for the time being and I&rsquo;ll try to keep them current. GitHub seems like a suitable place but it&rsquo;s unclear what format is best. Still wish I could describe dimensional work like I did in elementary school using Seymour Papert&rsquo;s <a href=https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation>Logo Programming Language</a> ðŸ¤“</p>

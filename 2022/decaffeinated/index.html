<p>Temptation is strong this morning. I’m rounding out week four of a months long abstinence from caffeine. The tricks my mind is playing are probably no different than an addict of any other substance. Why wait another week, it’s basically been a month? This is a silly game? What’s the difference between today and next Friday? I concede this is somewhat arbitrary but in the end I&rsquo;ll be somewhat proud of myself. Discipline is a scarce resource among us humans and I’m doing my best to impose just a little.</p>

<p>I’m so excited to map out a workbench this weekend. I’ve acquired all the necessary tools with the exception of a few I may need. A two inch butt chisel and maybe a panel saw depending on what dimensional lumber go with. My inspiration is peaking with this Bibbings & Hensby chair makers workbench. For the small space I currently inhabit it appears to be a perfect size with a top 25” by 30” and 31.5” tall. My current interests are small pieces at the moment: some stools, frames, end tables and if I dare, a Windsor. The research I&rsquo;ve done so far turned up a few other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://shawnmurphywindsorchairs.com/tools-supplies-work-benches.aspx>Shawn Murphy</a> sells a 4” thick top that’s 32” by 30” and 31.5” tall.</li>
<li><a href=https://www.curtisbuchananchairmaker.com/store/p23/Workbench_Plans_%28digital_download%29.html>Curtis Buchanan</a> sells some nice plans for a 3” thick top that’s 28” by 22.25” and 33” tall.</li>
<li><a href=http://greg-aroundtheshop.blogspot.com/2014/05/short-and-sweet-chairmakers-bench.html>Greg Pennington</a> built a walnut bench that appears to be 4” thick and 26.5” square.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still need to pour over the details to understand all the tradeoffs. The leg vise looks like the best option but I don’t want to rule out a moxon vise. A tail vise feels like overkill given the dimensions. The dueling holdfasts on the Bibbings example seems practical. The joinery on all the examples I’ve seen so far look much simpler compared to a traditional Roubo. I’ll report back when I’ve settled on some plans.</p>

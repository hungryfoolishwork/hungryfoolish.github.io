<p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> — Plywood is wonderful. You can trust with almost certainty it&rsquo;s flat and square which jumpstarts your adventures (baltic birch is your friend). There are gobs of YouTubers making cool things with plywood. I could not stop watching <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1V-DYqsaj764uBis9-UDug>Chris Salomone</a> build all kinds of furniture, have no idea how I found him but he does a great job inspiring by way of talking through the process. Cristiana at <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETeXD_3awsQv-9rSdCYXQQ>Get Hands Dirty</a> has some great builds as well that are almost meditative to sit through. YouTube is filled with this stuff. It&rsquo;s also filled with tool reviews.</p>
<p>The urge to start buying tools happens quickly. After watching many tool reviews it became clear few could be trusted. Everyone is either sponsored by Woodpecker, Rockler or Kreg — all great brands but often overpriced and unnecessary. I started out with some essentials to make picture frames and prototype some furniture.</p>
<p>It became pretty clear the first thing I needed was a table saw. Now, I could have bought a very affordable yellow branded saw but did the math and realized a trip to the emergency room (along with pain and suffering) wasn&rsquo;t worth skimping. So I bought the <a href=https://www.sawstop.com/table-saws/by-model/jobsite-saw>SawStop jobsite saw</a>, not cheap but it will refuse to saw off your fingers and cut wood like butter. I also like how easily it folds up as I have very little space to persue this passion.</p>
<p>The next tools I picked up were a good cordless drill and driver. I went with <a href=https://www.metabo.com/us/enus/>Metabo</a> because I saw a lot of construction workers using their stuff. It&rsquo;s good to be consistent because you&rsquo;ll want the freedom to swap batteries across power tools. At the time Metabo was the only brand with a multi-volt battery option which seemed beneficial down the road.</p>
<p>The next few things I bought were not necessary and I regret spending so much money on jigs that make it easy to cut miters or small pieces of material. When you watch people use these damn things it&rsquo;s hard to resist, I have learned my lesson. The last thing I bought was a combination square. Spent too much money on a trendy <a href=https://www.woodpeck.com/mini-in-dexable-squares.html>red aluminum thingy</a> when I should have just bought a Starrett.</p>
<p>With those tools I was able to build some nice picture frames out of elm. After getting comfortable with the table saw I went on to build very basic furniture out of cheap plywood. It&rsquo;s not furniture I&rsquo;m proud of but it&rsquo;s functional and helping me take baby steps towards the more serious world of hand tools and joinery.</p>

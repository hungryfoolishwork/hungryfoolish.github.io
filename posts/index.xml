        <p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> ‚Äî¬†Downing my second espresso this morning in our small town coffeehouse as the weekend tourists pass through on their way to the mountains. This weekend I&rsquo;ll be building the legs and stretchers for my chairmakers workbench.</p>
<p>Plans are in a good place, spent many evenings watching YouTube and reading Christopher Schwarz&rsquo;s <a href="https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-workbench">Anarchist&rsquo;s Workbench</a>. Everything has been helpful to understand the craft and tactics involved in construction.</p>

<p>Getting into woodworking for me, specifically hand-tool woodworking, is meant to be a reprieve from the computer. Plans could be made entirely on paper but my mind is so used to thinking at the speed of software like Sketch or Figma it&rsquo;s hard to discard it completely. SketchUp, the tool most amateurs use to model in three dimensions was an option but I have a long hatred of modeling software. It&rsquo;s always felt fussy and too easy to get lost within. I don&rsquo;t really feel the need to spin things around in three dimensions on a screen, I can do that pretty well in my own mind. Having a way to do isometric sketches would be as close to 3d as I&rsquo;m willing to go.</p>

<p>A little about the bench, it&rsquo;s inspired by the Curtis Buchanan bench Bibbings &amp; Hensby <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CazMzEHFDYC/">built recently</a>. A chairmakers workbench has a smaller top and is a little deeper. Using cheap and readily available Douglas Fur. No electric planer or jointer means I&rsquo;ll be relying entirely on hand planes to wrestle the boards to be flat and square. The top is laminated which took a few evenings to get flat (felt more like therapy than work). There leg vice will use <a href="https://www.benchcrafted.com/classic">Benchcrafted hardware</a> and there will be a series of bench dogs in front of the vice. I&rsquo;d like to use a couple holdfasts but unsure about placement. Most holdfasts I&rsquo;ve found are 1&quot; in diameter rather than 3/4&quot;. Is it typical to have different sized holes for bench dogs and holdfasts? Hopefully in a couple days I&rsquo;ll have a freestanding bench ready to accept a vice ü§û</p>

<p>The woodworking community should share plans more freely like the Open Source community I&rsquo;m so used to. Mine will be <a href="https://github.com/hungryfoolishwork/workbenches">here</a> for the time being and I&rsquo;ll try to keep them current. GitHub seems like a suitable place but it&rsquo;s unclear what format is best. Still wish I could describe dimensional work like I did in elementary school using Seymour Papert&rsquo;s <a href="https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation">Logo Programming Language</a> ü§ì</p>

        <p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> ‚Äî¬†Temptation is strong this morning. I‚Äôm rounding out week four of a months long abstinence from caffeine. The tricks my mind is playing are probably no different than an addict of any other substance. Why wait another week, it‚Äôs basically been a month? This is a silly game? What‚Äôs the difference between today and next Friday? I concede this is somewhat arbitrary but in the end I&rsquo;ll be somewhat proud of myself. Discipline is a scarce resource among us humans and I‚Äôm doing my best to impose just a little.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm so excited to map out a workbench this weekend. I‚Äôve acquired all the necessary tools with the exception of a few I may need. A two inch butt chisel and maybe a panel saw depending on what dimensional lumber go with. My inspiration is peaking with this Bibbings &amp; Hensby chair makers workbench. For the small space I currently inhabit it appears to be a perfect size with a top 25‚Äù by 30‚Äù and 31.5‚Äù tall. My current interests are small pieces at the moment: some stools, frames, end tables and if I dare, a Windsor. The research I&rsquo;ve done so far turned up a few other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shawnmurphywindsorchairs.com/tools-supplies-work-benches.aspx">Shawn Murphy</a> sells a 4‚Äù thick top that‚Äôs 32‚Äù by 30‚Äù and 31.5‚Äù tall.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.curtisbuchananchairmaker.com/store/p23/Workbench_Plans_%28digital_download%29.html">Curtis Buchanan</a> sells some nice plans for a 3‚Äù thick top that‚Äôs 28‚Äù by 22.25‚Äù and 33‚Äù tall.</li>
<li><a href="http://greg-aroundtheshop.blogspot.com/2014/05/short-and-sweet-chairmakers-bench.html">Greg Pennington</a> built a walnut bench that appears to be 4‚Äù thick and 26.5‚Äù square.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still need to pour over the details to understand all the tradeoffs. The leg vise looks like the best option but I don‚Äôt want to rule out a moxon vise. A tail vise feels like overkill given the dimensions. The dueling holdfasts on the Bibbings example seems practical. The joinery on all the examples I‚Äôve seen so far look much simpler compared to a traditional Roubo. I‚Äôll report back when I‚Äôve settled on some plans.</p>

        <p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> ‚Äî¬†Plywood is wonderful. You can trust with almost certainty it&rsquo;s flat and square which jumpstarts your adventures (baltic birch is your friend). There are gobs of YouTubers making cool things with plywood. I could not stop watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1V-DYqsaj764uBis9-UDug">Chris Salomone</a> build all kinds of furniture, have no idea how I found him but he does a great job inspiring by way of talking through the process. Cristiana at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCETeXD_3awsQv-9rSdCYXQQ">Get Hands Dirty</a> has some great builds as well that are almost meditative to sit through. YouTube is filled with this stuff. It&rsquo;s also filled with tool reviews.</p>
<p>The urge to start buying tools happens quickly. After watching many tool reviews it became clear few could be trusted. Everyone is either sponsored by Woodpecker, Rockler or Kreg ‚Äî all great brands but often overpriced and unnecessary. I started out with some essentials to make picture frames and prototype some furniture.</p>
<p>It became pretty clear the first thing I needed was a table saw. Now, I could have bought a very affordable yellow branded saw but did the math and realized a trip to the emergency room (along with pain and suffering) wasn&rsquo;t worth skimping. So I bought the <a href="https://www.sawstop.com/table-saws/by-model/jobsite-saw">SawStop jobsite saw</a>, not cheap but it will refuse to saw off your fingers and cut wood like butter. I also like how easily it folds up as I have very little space to persue this passion.</p>
<p>The next tools I picked up were a good cordless drill and driver. I went with <a href="https://www.metabo.com/us/enus/">Metabo</a> because I saw a lot of construction workers using their stuff. It&rsquo;s good to be consistent because you&rsquo;ll want the freedom to swap batteries across power tools. At the time Metabo was the only brand with a multi-volt battery option which seemed beneficial down the road.</p>
<p>The next few things I bought were not necessary and I regret spending so much money on jigs that make it easy to cut miters or small pieces of material. When you watch people use these damn things it&rsquo;s hard to resist, I have learned my lesson. The last thing I bought was a combination square. Spent too much money on a trendy <a href="https://www.woodpeck.com/mini-in-dexable-squares.html">red aluminum thingy</a> when I should have just bought a Starrett.</p>
<p>With those tools I was able to build some nice picture frames out of elm. After getting comfortable with the table saw I went on to build very basic furniture out of cheap plywood. It&rsquo;s not furniture I&rsquo;m proud of but it&rsquo;s functional and helping me take baby steps towards the more serious world of hand tools and joinery.</p>

        <p><strong>NEVADA CITY</strong> ‚Äî¬†My name is <a href="https://nathan.run">Nathan</a> and nothing brings me more joy than making something useful. Writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others was my story for the past two decades. This continues to be my day job but I&rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to occupy my free time.</p>
<p>When I was younger I couldn&rsquo;t wait to race home and work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard. Nowadays it&rsquo;s hard to wrestle with big corporate frameworks, programming languages, software that I&rsquo;m always upgrading and paying for and ‚Äî god help us all ‚Äî dependencies and build systems. I&rsquo;ve also helped bring a small child into the world and something is really tugging at me to create more useful physical objects the two of us can form memories around.</p>

<p>So, in a blaze of cliche glory I&rsquo;m going to jump headlong into the world of woodworking, and maybe some other interests like sewing, felting, printmaking&hellip; you get the idea, physical stuff. Writing helps keep me honest so I&rsquo;ll do my best to document this adventure.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, depression is no stranger and I&rsquo;m sure many reading this know too well the crushing force it can have on the day-to-day. If I&rsquo;m not using my hands or mind, if I&rsquo;m not feeling useful to others then my defenses weaken. The hunger to do never completely fades and starting something new is always scary, all attempts feel imperfect and low quality. Embracing a foolish mindset, laughing at mistakes, getting in over my head is how I&rsquo;ve always discovered new joys.</p>

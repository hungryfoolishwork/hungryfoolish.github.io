A good chunk of my life was spent writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others. This continues to be my day job but I\u0026rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to ocupy my free time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was younger I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to race home to work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard. Nowadays I can\u0026rsquo;t muster the will to wrestle with big corporate frameworks, programming languages, software that I\u0026rsquo;m always upgrading and paying for or — god help us all — dependencies and build systems. I\u0026rsquo;ve also helped bring a small child into this world and something is really tugging at me to create more useful physical objects the two of us can create memories with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"small right\"\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"/photos/2018-10-13_IMG_2092.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/photos/2018-10-13_IMG_2092.jpeg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n        In 2018 I attended the 50 year anniversary of the Whole Earth Catalog.\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in a blaze of cliche glory I\u0026rsquo;m going to jump headlong into the world of woodworking (and maybe some other interests like sewing, felting, printmaking\u0026hellip; you get the idea, physical stuff). Writing helps keep me honest so I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to document this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a more personal note, depression is no stranger and I\u0026rsquo;m sure many reading this probably know too well the crushing force it can have on one\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day. For me, if I\u0026rsquo;m not using my hands or my mind, if I\u0026rsquo;m not feeling useful to others then my defenses are weakened. The \u003cstrong\u003ehunger\u003c/strong\u003e to do, never completely fades but starting something new is always scary, all attempts will feel imperfect and low quality. Embrasing a \u003cstrong\u003efoolish\u003c/strong\u003e mentality, laughing at the mistakes, getting in over my head is how I\u0026rsquo;ve always fallen into new joys.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]}

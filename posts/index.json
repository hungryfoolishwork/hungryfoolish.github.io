Writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others was my story for the past two decades. This continues to be my day job but I\u0026rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to ocupy my free time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was younger I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to race home and work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard. Nowadays it\u0026rsquo;s hard to wrestle with big corporate frameworks, programming languages, software that I\u0026rsquo;m always upgrading and paying for and — god help us all — dependencies and build systems. I\u0026rsquo;ve also helped bring a small child into the world and something is really tugging at me to create more useful physical objects the two of us can form memories around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"small right\"\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"/photos/2018-10-13_IMG_2092.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/photos/2018-10-13_IMG_2092.jpeg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n        In 2018 I attended the 50 year anniversary of the Whole Earth Catalog at Fort Mason in San Francisco. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been inspired by this quote.\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in a blaze of cliche glory I\u0026rsquo;m going to jump headlong into the world of woodworking, and maybe some other interests like sewing, felting, printmaking\u0026hellip; you get the idea, physical stuff. Writing helps keep me honest so I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to document this adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a more personal note, depression is no stranger and I\u0026rsquo;m sure many reading this know too well the crushing force it can have on the day-to-day. If I\u0026rsquo;m not using my hands or my mind, if I\u0026rsquo;m not feeling useful to others then my defenses weaken. The hunger to do never completely fades but starting something new is always scary, all attempts feel imperfect and low quality. Embrasing a foolish mindset, laughing at mistakes, getting in over my head is how I\u0026rsquo;ve always fallen into new joys.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}]}

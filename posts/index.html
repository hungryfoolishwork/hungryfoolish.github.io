<h4>Friday, March 25, 2022</h4>

Temptation is strong this morning. I’m rounding out week four of a months long abstinence from caffeine. The tricks my mind is playing are probably no different than an addict of any other substance. Why wait another week, it’s basically been a month? This is a silly game? What’s the difference between today and next Friday? I concede this is somewhat arbitrary but in the end I&rsquo;ll be somewhat proud of myself.

Plywood is wonderful. You can trust with almost certainty it&rsquo;s flat and square which jumpstarts your adventures (baltic birch is your friend). There are gobs of YouTubers making cool things with plywood. I could not stop watching Chris Salomone build all kinds of furniture, have no idea how I found him but he does a great job inspiring by way of talking through the process. Cristiana at Get Hands Dirty has some great builds as well that are almost meditative to sit through.

NEVADA CITY — My name is Nathan and nothing brings me more joy than making something useful. Writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others was my story for the past two decades. This continues to be my day job but I&rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to occupy my free time.
When I was younger I couldn&rsquo;t wait to race home and work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard.

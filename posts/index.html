Plywood is wonderful. You can trust with almost certainty it&rsquo;s flat and square which allows you to jumpstart your adventures. Baltic birch is your friend. There are gobs of YouTubers making cool things with plywood. I could not stop watching Chris Salomone build all kinds of furniture, have no idea how I found him but he does a great job filming and talking through the process. Cristiana at Get Hands Dirty has some great builds that are almost meditative to sit through.

NEVADA CITY — My name is Nathan and nothing brings me more joy than making something useful. Writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others was my story for the past two decades. This continues to be my day job but I&rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to occupy my free time.
When I was younger I couldn&rsquo;t wait to race home and work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard.

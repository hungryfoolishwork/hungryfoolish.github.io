**NEVADA CITY** — My name is [Nathan](https://nathan.run) and nothing brings me more joy than making something useful. A good chunk of my life was spent writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others. This continues to be my day job but I've recently decided I need a new challenge to ocupy my free time. 

When I was younger I couldn't wait to race home to work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard. Nowadays I can't muster the will to wrestle with big corporate frameworks, programming languages, software that I'm always upgrading and paying for or — god help us all — dependencies and build systems. I've also helped bring a small child into this world and something is really tugging at me to create more useful physical objects the two of us can create memories with.

So, in a blaze of cliche glory I'm going to jump headlong into the world of woodworking (and maybe some other interests like sewing, felting, printmaking... you get the idea, physical stuff). Writing helps keep me honest so I'll do my best to document this journey.

On a more personal note, depression is no stranger and I'm sure many reading this probably know too well the crushing force it can have on one's day-to-day. For me, if I'm not using my hands or my mind, if I'm not feeling useful to others then my defenses are weakened. The **hunger** to do, never completely fades but starting something new is always scary, all attempts will feel imperfect and low quality. Embrasing a **foolish** mentality, laughing at the mistakes, getting in over my head is how I've always fallen into new joys.

<p>NEVADA CITY — My name is Nathan and nothing brings me more joy than making something useful. A good chunk of my life was spent writing code and pushing around pixels on a screen in an attempt to make something of value for others. This continues to be my day job but I&rsquo;ve recently decided I need a new challenge to ocupy my free time.
When I was younger I couldn&rsquo;t wait to race home to work on side-projects, all involving a screen and a keyboard.</p>

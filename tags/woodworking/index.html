Plywood is wonderful. You can trust with almost certainty it&rsquo;s flat and square which jumpstarts your adventures (baltic birch is your friend). There are gobs of YouTubers making cool things with plywood. I could not stop watching Chris Salomone build all kinds of furniture, have no idea how I found him but he does a great job inspiring by way of talking through the process. Cristiana at Get Hands Dirty has some great builds as well that are almost meditative to sit through.
